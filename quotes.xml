            <p>Some dudes like to say that men have the instinct to spread their seed, while women are 
              supposed to protect their reproductive organs from everything but the best sperm for the 
              strongest potential offspring. By that logic every woman in the world should be saving 
              herself for Dwayne <q>The Rock</q> Johnson and never let any of you shitheads touch her. 
              Seriously, you guys should stop using that argument.</p>

            <p>Some bitter boys reading this might accuse me of <soCalled>friend-zoning,</soCalled> but 
              I’d like to say that even if a girl has misinterpreted a situation that someone else thinks 
              is obvious, she does not owe her male friends anything.<note>
                <p>Needless to say, this applies to every arrangement of gender and orientation. I mention 
                  males pressuring females because that’s been my only personal experience of it, but it 
                  turns out my personal journey isn’t an infallible barometer of the entire human experience. 
                  Weird, right?</p>

            <p>They thought the facades of the houses very magnificent—they could not praise them highly 
              enough. But the sad decay, which buildings, bridges and church all displayed, seemed to 
              charm them even more. They were Englishmen, and, to them, the decline of other nations was 
              the most natural thing in the world. They belonged to a race blessed with so sensitive an 
              appreciation of its own talents (and so doubtful of any body else’s) that they would not 
              have been surprized to learn that the Venetians themselves had been entirely ignorant of 
              the merits of their own city—until Englishmen had come to tell them it was delightful.</p>

            <p>It is precisely by passing judgements upon other people’s work and pointing out their 
              errors that readers can be made to understand your own opinions better. It is the easiest 
              thing in the world to turn a review to one’s own ends. One only need mention the book 
              once or twice and for the rest of the article one may develop one’s theme just as one 
              chuses.</p>

            <p>The true surrender, the difficult one, is to yourself. There are times to surrender to 
              your anger—your wrath, your passion—and let it move you. Like Odhinn on the tree—which is 
              a story from an older world—you give <emph rend="italic">yourself</emph> up for the power 
              that changes the world. It is not capitulation and it is not resignation of which I speak. 
              It is ceasing to divide your strength by fighting against yourself.</p>

            <p>There is no point in treating a depressed person as though she were just feeling sad, 
              saying, There now, hang on, you’ll get over it. Sadness is more or less like a head 
              cold—with patience, it passes. Depression is like cancer.</p>

            <p>While I’ve got nothing but contempt for <quote>Don’t feed the trolls</quote> and people 
              suggesting not participating in the internet as the cure for online abuse, for some 
              folks, bowing out might be what they ultimately know is best for them, and that’s 
              okay. I have just as many curses for those who pressure people to stay against their 
              wishes, or look down on them for it, as I do for the people telling folks to just go 
              offline. It’s not a sign of weakness to say, <said>You know what? Fuck this. Life is 
              too short,</said> and bounce out of a bad situation, whether that means deleting your 
              accounts or switching careers. Having serious periods of introspection and figuring 
              out what you want, what it would take to get there, and whether it’s worth that is a 
              key part of navigating any of life’s curveballs. If your answer is that you deserve 
              better than what you’re getting and need to move on with your life, that’s not 
              weakness—it’s inner strength. It’s hardly an easy way out to leave everything behind 
              and start over. Choosing to give up the things that are making you more miserable 
              than happy and building new things in their place takes a lot of work, guts, and 
              strength. It’s crucial not to add unfair guilt or shame for taking care of yourself 
              to that long to-do list.</p>

            <p>Mistakes, once owned, apologized for, and buried, need to be an accepted part of 
              life. Instead of treating old and atoned-for mistakes as forever damning, we should 
              look at past versions of people like rings in a tree. It can’t be about 
              <soCalled>being good</soCalled>; it has to be about doing better. It can’t be about 
              <soCalled>deserving and undeserving</soCalled> targets; we have to draw lines between 
              acceptable and abusive behavior.</p>

            <p>For humans, stories form the bridge between data and understanding. They’re 
              where we look when we need to contextualize something new. Or to recognize 
              something we’re pretty sure we’ve seen before. They’re how we identify ourselves, 
              they’re how we locate ourselves and each other in the larger world.</p>

            <p>Up to this point in telling the story of Orlando’s life, documents, both 
              private and historical, have made it possible to fulfil the first duty of a 
              biographer, which is to plod, without looking to right or left, in the indelible 
              footprints of truth; unenticed by flowers; regardless of shade; on and on 
              methodically till we fall plump into the grave and write

            <p>Change was incessant, and change perhaps would never cease. High battlements of

            <p>In those days I would come out of the house, turn onto Flatbush Avenue, and my 
              face would tighten like a Mexican wrestler’s mask, my eyes would dart from 
              corner to corner, my arms loose, limber, and ready. This need to be always on 
              guard was an unmeasured expenditure of energy, the slow siphoning of the essence. 
              It contributed to the fast breakdown of our bodies. So I feared not just the 
              violence of this world but the rules designed to protect you from it, the rules 
              that would have you contort your body to address the block, and contort again to 
              be taken seriously by colleagues, and contort again so as not to give the police 
              a reason. All my life I’d heard people tell their black boys and black girls to 
              <said>be twice as good,</said> which is to say <said>accept half as much.</said> 
              These words would be spoken with a veneer of religious nobility, as though they 
              evidenced some unspoken quality, some undetected courage, when in fact all they 
              evidenced was the gun to our head and the hand in our pocket. This is how we 
              lose our softness. This is how they steal our right to smile. No one told those 
              little white children, with their tricycles, to be twice as good. I imagined 
              their parents telling them to take twice as much. It seemed to me that our own 
              rules redoubled plunder. It struck me that perhaps the defining feature of being 
              drafted into the black race was the inescapable robbery of time, because the 
              moments we spent readying the mask, or readying ourselves to accept half as much, 
              could not be recovered. The robbery of time is not measured in lifespans but in 
              moments. It is the last bottle of wine that you have just uncorked but do not 
              have the time to drink. It is the kiss that you do not have time to share, 
              before she walks out of your life. It is the raft of second chances for them, 
              and twenty-three-hour days for us.</p>

            <p>The mettle that it takes to look away from the horror of our prison system, 
              from police forces transformed into armies, from the long war against the black 
              body, is not forged overnight. This is the practiced habit of jabbing out one’s 
              eyes and forgetting the work of one’s hands. To acknowledge these horrors means 
              turning away from the brightly rendered version of your country as it has always 
              declared itself and turning toward something murkier and unknown. It is still 
              too difficult for most Americans to do this. But that is your work. It must be, 
              if only to preserve the sanctity of your mind.</p>

            <p>I am sorry that I cannot make it okay. I am sorry that I cannot save you—but 
              not that sorry. Part of me thinks that your very vulnerability brings you closer 
              to the meaning of life, just as for others, the quest to believe oneself white 
              divides them from it. The fact is that despite their dreams, their lives are 
              also not inviolable. When their own vulnerability becomes real—when the police 
              decide that tactics intended for the ghetto should enjoy wider usage, when their 
              armed society shoots down their children, when nature sends hurricanes against 
              their cities—they are shocked in a way that those of us who were born and bred 
              to understand cause and effect can never be. And I would not have you live like 
              them. You have been cast into a race in which the wind is always at your face 
              and the hounds are always at your heels. And to varying degrees this is true of 
              all life. The difference is that you do not have the privilege of living in 
              ignorance of this essential fact.</p>
            <p>I am speaking to you as I always have—as the sober and serious man I have 
              always wanted you to be, who does not apologize for his human feelings, who does 
              not make excuses for his height, his long arms, his beautiful smile. You are 
              growing into consciousness, and my wish for you is that you feel no need to 
              constrict yourself to make other people comfortable. None of that can change the 
              math anyway. I never wanted you to be twice as good as them, so much as I have 
              always wanted you to attack every day of your brief life in struggle. The people 
              who must believe they are white can never be your measuring stick. I would not 
              have you descend into your own dream. I would have you be a conscious citizen of 
              this terrible and beautiful world.</p>

            <p>When you’re historically the one with the power relative to another, if you
              really want to correct the imbalance, you have to be willing to hear pent-up
              rage and not retaliate. You have to be willing to acknowledge your actions that
              make you complicit. You have to be willing to apologize and then take visible,
              effective steps toward righting the imbalance.<note>
              <p>I’m not asking people to do anything I haven’t done. I’ve wronged and
                probably will wrong enough people in my time that I’ve have ample opportunity
                to put myself through the process of apology, addressing/redressing and
                hopefully reconciliation. I know in my bones how badly it grates. But I also
                know that it works, and that the subsequent healing soothes away the grating
                feeling.</p></note>

            <p>It’s not that re-reading isn’t pleasurable, but there’s no sense of
              urgency to it. Even if I’ve forgotten the details, the general flow of
              the shape of the story will be in my mind, so that things will come
              back to me before I get to them, and I’ll at least half-remember
              what’s going on. Going on to a new one is entirely different.
              Suddenly, it is urgent. What is going on? Will characters I care about
              survive? Why is this happening? It’s like, and yet unlike, the
              difference between reminiscence and experience. What it’s actually
              like is when you’re on a long familiar trip, and you’re looking out
              the window from time to time but mostly reading your book, and then
              the train takes a detour and you’re suddenly way up in the mountains
              and you drop your book because you’re suddenly riveted to the view out
              of the window. Only, you know, the other way around.</p>

            <p>I expect that if you did a survey, people wouldn’t say that they
              valued masculine virtues above feminine virtues, and likewise they
              wouldn’t say that the depressing is inherently better than the
              uplifting. Nevertheless, in written fiction this does seem to be
              people’s unconscious bias. There are more downer books than
              heartwarming ones, and those heartwarming ones there are get scoffed
              at and diminished. Nobody calls <title>Nineteen Eighty-Four</title> a
              <soCalled>guilty pleasure.</soCalled></p>

            <p>In gratifying the self, novels foster self-love and a tendency to
              self-assertion that would make the mind ungovernable and thus
              jeopardize the agencies of social and psychological control. That most
              readers of novels (and virtually all those who read novels only) were
              thought to be women and youth made particularly ominous the
              implications of a novel reading based on self-gratification as opposed
              to social feelings.</p>

            <p>The category of female author was not symmetrical with that of the male
              author because there was no such latter category; there were authors and
              female authors. Female authors were examples of a special case defined in
              such a way as to put genius out of woman’s reach. It need hardly be said
              that no man would have wished to distinguish himself by achieving female
              genius. To achieve female genius, to signal oneself as a female writer, was
              to take on a variant or deviant authorial role, author as woman. Author as
              woman accepted use and morality as her fictional aims, and she sacrificed
              greatness and genius. Women authors and women editors and reviewers
              cooperated in the construction of this special role for women authors. The
              purpose of this role was to neutralize the threat of the woman author by
              setting her to work on behalf of true womanhood.</p>

              together—things blow up, people’s feelings get hurt, and then you

            <p>Not strictly true, and yet it explains a lot.
              <gap extent="about a page" reason="omitted, but the whole thing is damn good"/></p>
            <p>In the vernacular it’s also hard to be <soCalled>classic,</soCalled>
              to be smooth, to be perfect. The Sacred Canon of Literature quite
              often pretends that some works are not only atemporal and universal
              (that is, outside of history, a religious claim) but without flaw and
              without perceptible limitations. It’s hard, in the vernacular, to
              pretend this, to paper over the cracks. It’s also hard to read the
              vernacular as Holy Writ (which some critics still do, interpreting
              even the typographical errors as genius).</p>
            <p>Minority art, vernacular art, is marginal art. Only on the margins
              does growth occur.</p>

            <p>I want to talk here about the difference between imagination and
              wishful thinking, because it’s important both in writing and in
              living. Wishful thinking is thinking cut loose from reality, a
              self-indulgence that is often merely childish, but may be dangerous.
              Imagination, even in its wildest flights, is not detached from
              reality: imagination acknowledges reality, starts from it, and returns
              to it to enrich it. Don Quixote indulges his longing to be a knight
              till he loses touch with reality and makes an awful mess of his life.
              That’s wishful thinking. Miguel Cervantes, by working out and telling
              the invented story of a man who wishes he were a knight, vastly
              increased our store of laughter and of human understanding. Wishful
              thinking is Hitler’s Thousand-Year Reich. Imagination is the
              Constitution of the United States.</p>
            <p>A failure to see this difference is in itself dangerous. If we assume
              that imagination has no connection with reality but is mere escapism,
              and therefore distrust it and suppress it, it will be crippled,
              perverted, it will fall silent or speak untruth. The imagination, like
              any basic human capacity, needs exercise, discipline, training,
              training, in childhood and lifelong.</p>

            <p>But centrality is the last thing accorded to a woman by the canoneers.
              Women must be left on the margins.</p>
            <p>Even when a woman novelist is admitted to be a first-rate artist, the
              techniques of exclusion still operate. Jane Austen is vastly admired,
              yet she is less often considered as an exemplar than as a unique,
              inimitable—a wonderful fluke. She cannot be disappeared; but she is
              not fully included.</p>
            <p>Denigration, omission, and exception during a writer’s lifetime are
              preparations for her disappearance after her death.</p>

            <p>There has been throughout human history a pretty strong feeling
              against killing a sleeping person or even animal. It was seen not only
              as unsporting, but as wicked. While asleep your enemy is not only
              helpless, but actually innocent. He has to be awake to be your enemy.
              Any such moral discrimination was lost when we started slaughtering at
              a safe distance and wholesale. In the target area being bombed there
              is only the Enemy, an abstract entity which is not considered human
              and therefore does not sleep and cannot be innocent.</p>

            <p>Fiction offers the best means of understanding people different from
              oneself, short of experience. Actually, fiction can be lots better
              than experience, because it’s a manageable size, it’s comprehensible,
              while experience just steamrollers over you and you understand what
              happened decades later, if ever. Fiction is terrific at giving
              factual, psychological, and moral understanding.</p>

            <p>Eichmann’s inability to speak coherently in court was connected with his
              incapacity to think, or to think from another person’s point of view. His
              shallowness was by no means identical with stupidity. He personified
              neither hatred or madness nor an insatiable thirst for blood, but something
              far worse, the faceless nature of Nazi evil itself, within a closed system
              run by pathological gangsters, aimed at dismantling the human personality
              of its victims. The Nazis had succeeded in turning the legal order on its
              head, making the wrong and the malevolent the foundation of a new
              <soCalled>righteousness.</soCalled> In the Third Reich evil lost its
              distinctive characteristic by which most people had then recognized it. The
              Nazis redefined it as a civil norm. Conventional goodness became a mere
              temptation which most Germans were fast learning to resist. Within this
              upside-down world Eichmann (perhaps like Pol Pot four decades later) seemed
              not to have been aware of having done evil. In matters of elementary
              morality, Arendt warned, what had been thought of as decent instincts were
              no longer to be taken for granted.</p>

            <p>Historians speak of social pressures as if they were physical laws,
              of <soCalled>unstoppable</soCalled> forces of change, of destiny. But for the men and
              women who walked the historical stage, these forces were often
              invisible, hidden by their sheer scale and the rank propaganda of the
              times. Social pressures built invisibly over lifetimes, not across the
              pages of a history text. And destiny only became apparent after the
              dice had been thrown. For those who experienced them directly,
              historical events were ruled by the fortunes of war, the whims of
              lovers, and dumb luck. Fate arises out of such humble parts as these.</p>

            <p>To be a good friend, you have to keep in touch. You have to send your
              friends notes that you are thinking of them, even if you are busy,
              even if you have a new boyfriend or girlfriend you want to kiss, even
              if you just send quick texts. You have to listen and remember things
              about them. You have to let their problems trump your own sometimes,
              even if you are frustrated about your life. You have to let them eat
              your French fries, even if they didn’t order them because they are on
              a diet.</p>
            <p>Let them borrow the clothes they want, but you do not have to let
              them borrow your makeup or your most expensive jewelry. Tell them what
              looks good on them, and what doesn’t. Be honest with them 99 percent
              of the time, but use a bit of honey when you are feeding them vinegar.
              Let them talk to you about the same problems a million times. Know
              their favorite foods and be prepared to bring those foods over when
              they are sick or in mourning. Be there. Use caution when criticizing
              their significant others, but never stand silent and watch them get
              hurt. Let them know when they are too drunk or too angry or being
              unfair. Let them know when they get stagnant. Give them unsolicited
              advice. Give them love. Give them good presents. Talk shit when
              necessary. Listen. Help them pick out a haircut. Tell them they are
              pretty. Tell them they are smart. Tell them how to ask for a raise at
              work. Set aside whole days for them. <hi rend="italic">BE THERE.</hi>
              And don’t break plans... twice in a row.</p>

            <p>Here’s the revolution: I want you to feel beautiful, and not so
              secretly. Feeling beautiful doesn’t mean you think you should be a
              supermodel: it means you like what you see when you see yourself. I
              want the world to be crawling with women who tell you that they think
              they are beautiful. I want to take all your flaws and shove them in
              the face of the world. I want you to say: <said>I don’t really care what
              you think about it, because I think it.</said> It takes away a little bit of
              that objectification that so often comes with being beautiful. And it
              <hi rend="italic">is</hi> brazen. A brazen love of yourself.</p>
            <p>You’ve spent all too long feeling <soCalled>just enough,</soCalled> and only beautiful
              when you are alone in your room. I challenge you to look the world in
              the face and say you love the way you look, and that you are beautiful
              the way you are born and also the way you choose to look. I want you
              to dance to that jam.</p>

            <p>She ran her fingers along the line of his jaw.</p>
            <p><said>You’re beautiful, Laurent.</said></p>
            <p>He shook his head. A smile played on his face, but his voice trembled
              as he spoke.</p>
            <p><said>I am in pieces, Nara.</said></p>
            <p><said>Your body is, Laurent. Not unlike my mind.</said></p>
            <p>Zai touched her forehead with the fingers of his flesh-and-blood hand.
              He drew some shape she didn’t recognize, a mark of his dark religion,
              or perhaps simply a random and meaningless sign.</p>
            <p><said>You began life in madness, Nara. But you wake up every day and
              cohere, pull yourself to sanity. I, on the other hand,</said> he lifted his
              gloved prosthetic, <said>possessed absolute surety as a child, piety and
              scripture. And every day I shatter more.</said></p>
            <p>Nara took both of Laurent’s hands in hers. The false one was as hard
              as metal, without the rubbery feel of a civilian prosthetic. It closed
              gently around her fingers.</p>
            <p>Nara Oxham ignored the cold pain of him. She grasped the living and
              the dead parts. Pushed her fingers into the strange interfaces between
              body and machine. She found the hidden latches that released his false
              members. Removed them. She saw his phantom limbs as if they were real.
              She put her mind into him.</p>
            <p><said>Shatter, then,</said> she said.</p>

            <p>But the social models of gender both fed and emerged from two sources
              of nineteenth-century biology: the embryological and the evolutionary.
              The idea that the public sphere was <hi rend="italic">by definition</hi>
              masculine lay so deep in this period’s metaphysical fabric that it did
              not seem surprising to argue that women who aspired to the Rights of
              Man had also, by definition, to be masculine.
              <note n="34" anchored="true">In a Catch-22, pointing to talented women
                did not help anyone arguing that women and men have the same
                capabilities, since the counter-argument would be that it was the
                male elements in their bodies that generated the talent.</note>

            <p>I find the Russian nesting doll useful for envisioning the various
              layers of human sexuality, from the cellular to the social and
              historical. Academics can take the system apart for display or to
              study one of the dolls in more detail. But an individual doll is
              hollow. Only the complete assembly makes sense. Unlike its wooden
              counterpart, the human nesting doll changes shape with time. Change
              can happen to any of the layers, but since the entire assembly has to
              fit together, altering one of the component dolls requires the
              interlinked system—from the cellular to the institutional—to
              change.</p>

            <p>The long-standing notion that femaleness represented a bodily absence,

              postwar insistence on the need for men to build their masculinity and
              women to follow passively their natural inclinations, partly explains
              why Jost and others accepted an underproven hypothesis.

            <p>The sociologist Bruno Latour argues that once a scientific finding
              becomes so thoroughly accepted that we dignify it by calling it a
              fact, placing it without question in textbooks and scientific
              dictionaries, it moves out of view, behind a veil that he refers to as
              a black box. Place a fact in a Latourian black box and people stop
              looking at it. Nobody asks whether, at the time of its origin, it
              functioned ideologically in the social or political arena or whether
              it embodied particular cultural practices or ways of seeing the world.</p>

          <p>The moments of magic—the appearance and disappearance of Mr. Lies and
            the ghosts, the Book hallucination, and the ending—are to be fully
            realized, as bits of wonderful <hi rend="italic">theatrical</hi>
            illusion—which means it’s OK if the wires show, and maybe it’s good that
            they do, but the magic should at the same time be thoroughly amazing.</p>

            <p>She put her head down in her arms and cried, and her cheeks were salt
              and wet. She cried for the waste of her years in bondage to a useless
              evil. She wept in pain, because she was free.</p>
            <p>What she had begun to learn was the weight of liberty. Freedom is a
              heavy load, a great and strange burden for the spirit to undertake. It
              is not easy. It is not a gift given, but a choice made, and the choice
              may be a hard one. The road goes upward towards the light; but the
              laden traveler may never reach the end of it.</p>

            <p>The fundamental objective of fanfic, especially when it is written
              by women, queer and genderqueer people, and people of color, is to
              insert yourself, aggressively and brazenly, into stories that are
              not about and were never intended to be about or represent you.

            <p>The techniques for mystifying women’s lives and belittling women’s
              writing that I have described work by suppressing context: writing is
              separated from experience, women writers are separated from their
              tradition and each other, public is separated from private, political
              from personal–all to enforce a supposed set of absolute standards.
              What is frightening about black art or women’s art or Chicano art–and
              so on– is that it calls into question the very idea of objectivity and
              absolute standards:</p>
            <p>This is a good novel.</p>
            <p>Good <hi rend="italic">for what</hi>?</p>
            <p>Good <hi rend="italic">for whom</hi>?</p>
            <p>One side of the nightmare is that the privileged group will not
              recognize that <soCalled>other</soCalled> art, will not be able to
              judge it, that the superiority of taste and training possessed by the
              privileged critic and the privileged artist will suddenly vanish.</p>
            <p>The other side of the nightmare is not that what is found in the
              <soCalled>other</soCalled> art will be incomprehensible, but that it
              will be all too familiar. That is:</p>
            <p>Women’s lives are the buried truth about men’s lives.</p>
            <p>The lives of people of color are the buried truth about white lives.</p>
            <p>The buried truth about the rich is who they take their money from and
              how.</p>
            <p>The buried truth about <soCalled>normal</soCalled> sexuality is how
              one kind of sexual expression has been made privileged, and what kinds
              of unearned virtue and terrors about identity this distinction serves.</p>

            <p>And yet there is beginning to be a response that goes beyond anger.
              Nowadays the statement <hi rend="italic">Women can’t write</hi>
              sometimes meets with neither strategies for evasion and re-definition,
              nor the appeal to truth, nor the appeal to models, nor even a direct
              confrontation, but a drastic shift in perspective which can only occur
              in the context of explicit feminism, after considerable open anger, and
              with the backing of feminist solidarity. This is a response I can only
              call <hi rend="italic">woman-centeredness</hi>. Thus, when Hacker writes

            <p>Conscious, conspiratorial guilt? Hardly. Privileged groups, like
              everyone else, want to think well of themselves and to believe that
              they are acting generously and justly. <gap extent="1 sentence" reason="omitted"/>
              Genuine ignorance? Certainly that is sometimes the case. But talk
              about sexism or racism must distinguish between the sins of
              commission of the real, active misogynist or bigot and the vague,
              half-conscious sins of omission of the decent, ordinary, even
              good-hearted people, which sins the context of institutionalized sexism
              and racism makes all too easy.</p>
            <p>I hesitate to mention this social dimension of sexism, racism, and
              class since it can be so easily used as an escape hatch by those too
              tired, too annoyed, too harried, or too comfortable to want to change.
              But it is true that although people are responsible for their actions,
              they are not responsible for the social context in which they must act
              or the social resources available to them. All of us must perforce
              accept large chunks of our culture ready-made; there is not enough
              energy and time to do otherwise. Even so, the results of such nonthought
              can be appalling. At the level of high culture with which this book is
              concerned, active bigotry is probably fairly rare. <hi rend="italic">It
                is also hardly ever necessary</hi>, since the social context is so far
              from neutral. To act in a way that is both sexist and racist, to
              maintain one’s class privilege, it is only necessary to act in the
              customary, ordinary, usual, even polite manner.</p>

            <p>But Proportion has a sister, less smiling, more formidable, a Goddess
              even now engaged... is even now engaged in dashing down shrines,
              smashing idols, and setting up in their place her own stern countenance.
              Conversion is her name and she feasts on the wills of the weakly, loving
              to impress, to impose, adoring her own features stamped on the face of
              the populace. At Hyde Park Corner on a tub she stands preaching; shrouds
              herself in white and walks penitentially disguised as brotherly love
              through factories and parliaments; offers help, but desires power;
              smites out of her way roughly the dissentient, or dissatisfied; bestows
              her blessing on those who, looking upward, catch submissively from her
              eyes the light of their own.</p>

            <p>When your fight has purpose – to free you from something, to interfere
              on the behalf of an innocent – it has the hope of finality. When the
              fight is about unraveling – when it is about your name, the places to
              which your blood is anchored, the attachment of your name to some
              landmark or event – there is nothing but hate, and the long, slow
              progression of people who feed it and are fed on it, meticulously, by
              the ones who come before them.</p>

            <p>Women have served all these centuries as looking-glasses possessing the
              magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of man at twice its
              natural size. Without that power probably the earth would still be swamp
              and jungle. The glories of all our wars would be unknown. We should
              still be scratching the outlines of deer on the remains of mutton bones
              and bartering flints for sheepskins or whatever simple ornament took our
              unsophisticated taste... The Czar and the Kaiser would never have worn
              their crowns or lost them. Whatever may be their use in civilised
              societies, mirrors are essential to all violent and heroic action. That
              is why Napoleon and Mussolini both insist so emphatically upon the
              inferiority of women, for if they were not inferior, they would cease to
              enlarge. That serves to explain in part the necessity that women so
              often are to men. And it serves to explain how restless they are under
              her criticism; how impossible it is for her to say to them this book is
              bad, this picture is feeble, or whatever it may be, without giving far
              more pain and rousing far more anger than a man would do who gave the
              same criticism. For if she begins to tell the truth, the figure in the
              looking-glass shrinks; his fitness for life is diminished. How is he to
              go on giving judgment, civilising natives, making laws, writing books,
              dressing up and speechifying at banquets, unless he can see himself at
              breakfast and at dinner at least twice the size he really is?</p>

            <p>Yet it seemed absurd, I thought, turning over the evening paper, that a
              man with all this power should be angry. Or is anger, I wondered,
              somehow, the familiar, the attendant sprite on power? ...Possibly they
              were not <soCalled>angry</soCalled> at all; often, indeed, they were admiring, devoted,
              exemplary in the relations of private life. Possibly when the professor
              insisted a little to emphatically upon the inferiority of women, he was
              concerned not with their inferiority, but with his own superiority. That
              was what he was protecting rather hot-headedly and with too much
              emphasis, because it was a jewel to him of the rarest price. Life for
              both sexes – and I looked at them, shouldering their way along the
              pavement – is arduous, difficult, a perpetual struggle. It calls for
              gigantic courage and strength. More than anything, perhaps, creatures of
              illusion as we are, it calls for confidence in oneself. Without this
              self-confidence we are as babes in the cradle. And how can we generate
              this imponderable quality, which is yet so invaluable, most quickly? By
              thinking that other people are inferior to oneself. By feeling that one
              has some innate superiority – it may be wealth, or rank, a straight
              nose, or the portrait of a grandfather by Romney – for there is no end
              to the pathetic devices of the human imagination – over other people.
              Hence the enormous importance to a patriarch who has to conquer, who has
              to rule, of feeling that great numbers of people, half the human race
              indeed, are by nature inferior to himself.</p>

            <p>Magical Girl stories are stories about growing up and becoming a woman,

              dreams and wishes and then kicking the bad guys in the face with your
              high heeled boots. The weapon is womanhood and girlhood and your

            <p>Life is a balance. We tend to forget that as we go blithely from day to
              day. We eat and drink and sleep and assume that we will always rise up
              the next day, that meals and rest will always replenish us. Injuries we
              expect to heal, and pain to lessen as times goes by. Even when we are
              faced with wounds that heal more slowly, with pain that lessens by day
              only to return in full force at nightfall, even when sleep does not
              leave us rested, we still expect that somehow tomorrow all will come
              back into balance and that we will go on. At some point, the exquisite
              balance has tipped, and the body that maintains itself to the body that
              struggles, nails clawing, to cling to what it used to be.</p>

            <p>I know this will sound glib, but don’t pretend you aren’t feeling what
              you feel. That’s how things slide to hell. Feelings are facts... Look
              straight at ’em and deal with ’em. Work it through, as honestly as you
              can. If God is anything like a middle-class white chick from the
              suburbs, which I admit is a long shot, it’s what you
              <hi rend="italic">do</hi> about what you feel that matters.</p>

            <p>The very first rule of <title rend="italic">Scooby-Doo</title>, the single premise that
              sits at the heart of their adventures, is that the world is full of
              grown-ups who lie to kids, and that it’s up to those kids to figure out
              what those lies are and call them on it, even if there are other adults
              who believe those lies with every fiber of their being. And the way that
              you win isn’t through supernatural powers, or even through fighting. The
              way that you win is by doing the most dangerous thing that any person
              being lied to by someone in power can do: You <hi rend="italic">think</hi>.</p>

            <p>You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore. You
              shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days. Aye,
              you shall be together even in the silent memory of God. But let there be
              spaces in your togetherness, and let the winds of heaven dance between
              you. Love one another, but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a
              moving sea between the shores of your souls. Fill each other’s cup but
              drink not from one cup. Give one another of your bread but eat not from
              the same loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one
              of you be alone, even as the strings of a lute are alone though they
              quiver with the same music.</p>

            <p>Nobody tells people who are beginners, and I really wish someone had
              told this to me... All of us who do creative work, we get into it. And
              we get into it because we have good taste... But it’s like there’s a
              <hi rend="italic">gap</hi>. For the first couple years you make stuff,
              it’s just not that good... It’s trying to be good, it has a mission to
              be good, but it’s not that good. But your <hi rend="italic">taste</hi>,
              the thing that got you into the game, is still <hi rend="italic">killer</hi>.
              And your taste is good enough that you can tell that
              what you’re making is kind of a disappointment to you... A lot of people
              never get past this phase. A lot of people, at that point, they quit.
              And the thing I would say to you with all my heart is that most
              everybody I know who do interesting, creative work, they went through a
              phase of <hi rend="italic">years</hi> [of this]... We knew [our work]
              didn’t have this special <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> that we want it to
              have. Everybody goes through that. And for you to go through that – if
              you’re just getting through it, if you’re just getting out of that
              phase, if you’re just starting out and you’re just entering into this
              phase, you gotta know that it’s totally normal and the most important
              possible thing you can do is do a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work.
              Put yourself on a deadline so that every week or every month you know
              you’re going to finish one story... It’s only by going through a volume
              of work that you’re actually going to catch up and close that gap, and
              the work you’re making will be as good as your ambitions... I took
              longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met... It
              takes awhile. It’s going to take <hi rend="italic">you</hi> awhile. It’s
              <hi rend="italic">normal</hi> to take awhile. You just gotta
              <hi rend="italic">fight your way through that</hi>. Okay? You will be
              fierce. You will be a warrior, and you will make things that aren’t as
              good as you know in your heart you want them to be, and you will just
              make one thing after another.</p>

            <p>Such tales by Bachmann work precisely because there are a great many
              people in America just like Bachmann, people who believe that God tells
              them what condiments to put on their hamburgers, who can’t tell the
              difference between Soviet Communism and a Stafford loan, but can
              certainly tell the difference between being mocked and being taken
              seriously. When you laugh at Michele Bachmann for going on MSNBC and
              blurting out that the moon is made of red communist cheese, these people
              don’t learn that she is wrong. What they learn is that you’re a dick,
              that they hate you more than ever, and that they’re even more determined
              now to support anyone who promises not to laugh at their own visions and
              fantasies.</p>

            <p>Paul D did not answer because she didn’t expect or want him to, but he
              did know what she meant. Listening to the doves in Alfred, Georgia, and
              having neither the right nor the permission to enjoy it because in that
              place mist, doves, sunlight, copper dirt, moon – everything belonged to
              the men who had the guns. Little men, some of them, big men too, each
              one of whom he could snap like a twig if he wanted to. Men who knew
              their manhood lay in their guns and were not even embarrassed by the
              knowledge that without gunshot fox would laugh at them. And these <soCalled>men</soCalled>
              who made even vixen laugh could, if you let them, stop you from hearing
              doves or loving moonlight. So you protected yourself and loved small.
              Picked the tiniest stars out of the sky to own; lay down with head
              twisted in order to see the loved one over the rim of the trench before
              you slept. Stole shy glances at her between the trees at chain-up. Grass
              blades, salamanders, spiders, woodpeckers, beetles, a kingdom of ants.
              Anything bigger wouldn’t do. A woman, a child, a brother – a big love
              like that would split you wide open in Alfred, Georgia. He knew exactly
              what she meant: to get to a place where you could love anything you
              chose – not to need permission for desire – well now,
              <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was freedom.</p>

            <p>Anything divine must come to us in worldly clothing, and so it comes to
              us altered. The divine is like rain striking the earth, and all our
              efforts at godliness are therefore muddy – all but those few seconds of
              complete inundation, the moments that the mystics describe, when we are
              nothing but rain. But those moments are always brief, as the sufis
              themselves admit. So we should let the occasional chalice break, if need
              be, to get at the truth of the water inside it.</p>

          <p>There’s a grosser irony about Politically Correct English. This is that
          PCE purports to be the dialect of progressive reform but is in fact-\-in
          its Orwellian substitution of the euphemisms of social equality for
          social equality itself-\-of vastly more help to conservatives and the US
          status quo than traditional SNOOT prescriptions ever were. Were I, for
          instance, a political conservative who opposed using taxation as a means
          of redistributing national wealth, I would be delighted to watch PC
          progressives spend their time and energy arguing over whether a poor
          person should be described as "low-income" or "economically
          disadvantaged" or "pre-prosperous" rather than constructing effective
          public arguments for redistributive legislation or higher marginal tax
          rates. ...In other words, PCE acts as a form of censorship, and
          censorship always serves the status quo.</p>

              and he turns away. Show him facts or figures and he questions your
              sources. Appeal to logic and he fails to see your point.</p>

            <p>I learned that the story has no beginning, and no story has an end.
              That the story is all muddle, all middle. That the story is never true,
              but that the lie is indeed a child of silence.</p>

              Because if the fairy stories of a hundred different cultures have one
              thing in common, it is this: they are simply sogged with humanity.
              Despite the fairies and brownies and elves and ogres and dragons and
              talking bears I found in them, the stories are about people and how
              people – the shy, the winsome, the frightened, the curious, the
              stubborn, the horrified, the careless and the careful – react to

            <p>Critics who treat ‘adult’ as a term of approval, instead of as a merely
              descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about
              being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush
              at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of
              childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in
              moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to
              carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about
              being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I
              read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been
              found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a
              man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and
              the desire to be very grown up.</p>

              out of the ashes, he got himself born all over again. And it looks like
              we’re doing the same thing, over and over, but we’ve got one damn thing
              the phoenix never had. We know the damn silly thing we just did. We know

            <p>Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said.
              A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of
              shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so
              your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that
              tree or that flower you planted, you’re there. It doesn’t matter what
              you do, he said, as long as you change something from the way it was
              before you touched it into something that’s like you after you take your

              and thus into his blood to feel touched and concerned by the meaning of
              the colorful men and women with the porcelain eyes and the blood-ruby
              lips. But there was nothing, nothing; it was a stroll through another

            <p>With the fall of dusk, things simultaneously expand and contract.
              ...The people thin out, and suddenly the extra interactions – the vacant
              smiles and nods that mean nothing – are stripped out as well, and every
              meeting becomes one of significance. You see only who you want to see,
              and if you see someone else, it’s because you wanted to see them and
              just didn’t know it. Or they wanted to see you.</p>

            <p>I tell people I don’t, but the truth is, I do think about it sometimes.
              My death. And yes, it does bring me comfort – but not as much as you’d
              think. Like just knowing a story has a happy ending alone doesn’t make
              it a good story. All you have is the effect without the cause. The
              <soCalled>then</soCalled> without the <soCalled>if.</soCalled> And life, I think, doesn’t work like that. You
              can’t just plot it out on a line graph, point to point, straight through
              to the end. It operates in many dimensions – each action, each decision,
              branching out in complex, often unexpected, directions</p>

            <p>When I’m asked why I decided to write the sort of thing I do write, I
              always think the question is more revealing than any answer I could
              possibly give. Wrapped within it, like the chewy stuff in the center of
              a Tootsie Pop, is the assumption that the writer controls the material
              instead of the other way around. The writer who is serious and committed
              is incapable of sizing up material the way an investor might size up
              various stock offerings, picking out the ones which seem likely to
              provide a good return.</p>

            <p>He let you down, Mister Trev. He wasn’t the small boy’s god. It turned
              out that he was only a man. But he was not only a man... If he was a
              fool, then any man who has ever climbed a mountain or swum a torrent is
              a fool. If he was a fool then so was the man who first tried to tame
              fire. If he was a fool then so was the man who tried the first oyster,
              he was a fool too... Perhaps only the fool gets out of bed. But, after
              death, some fools shine like stars, and your father is such a one. After
              death, people forget the foolishness, but they do remember the shine.
              You could not have done anything. You could not have stopped him. If you
              could have stopped him he would not have been Dave Likely, a name that
              means football to thousands of people.</p>

            <p>It is true that totalitarian domination tried to establish these holes of
              oblivion into which all deeds, good and evil, would disappear, but just as
              the Nazis’ feverish attempts, from June, 1942, on, to erase all traces of
              the massacres—through cremation, through burning in open pits, through the
              use of explosives and flame-throwers and bone-crushing machinery—were
              doomed to failure, so all efforts to let their opponents <quote>disappear
              in silent anonymity</quote> were in vain. The holes of oblivion do not exist.
              Nothing human is that perfect, and there are simply too many people in the
              world to make oblivion possible. One man will always be left alive to tell
              the story. Hence, nothing can ever be <quote>practically useless,</quote>
              at least, not in the long run. It would be of great practical usefulness
              for Germany today, not merely for her prestige abroad but for her sadly
              confused inner condition, if there were more such stories to be told.
              For the lesson of such stories is simple and within everybody’s grasp.
              Politically speaking, it is that under conditions of terror most people
              will comply but <hi rend="italic">some people will not,</hi> just as the
              lesson of the countries to which the Final Solution was proposed is that
              <quote>it could happen</quote> in most places but <hi rend="italic">it did not
              happen everywhere</hi>. Humanly speaking, no more is required, and no more
              can reasonably be asked, for this planet to remain a place fit for human
              habitation.</p>

            <p>It’s too late for the government to train me to be a weapon. For
              someone to approach me on the street, and to tell me I match a certain
              profile. I probably won’t even learn another language well enough to
              speak it fluently. Giant crazed attack dogs won’t ever suddenly act like
              scared puppies when they see me. I won’t ever be a grandmaster of chess,
              either. I don’t think at this stage I can even reasonably expect to make
              Expert. There are some things I regret as I get older, I guess. There
              are a ton of traditional ways to be bad-ass, and I missed the boat. But
              that’s okay. It just means I have to be more creative. And then later
              that creativity will make people think I was an evil genius, instead of
              just so desperate for a world with monsters that I didn’t mind becoming
              one myself. What I’m saying is - I stole an ice cream cone yesterday
              from the 7-11 and I have no regrets at all. </p>

            <p>I believe what I’ve done is come to the conclusion that you don’t
              ‘make’ yourself – that implies that you’re half-finished or otherwise
              defective, and that’s just silly. It’s more like discovering yourself,
              and figuring out who that person is that you are, and how you relate to
              the rest of the world, and how that relating affects how people relate
              to you.</p>

              might be swept off to.</p>

            <p>There are moments when the zippy narrative of your life lets up, and
              swampy reflection sinks in. There are moments when you begin to feel
              ending. Maybe it’s just seasonal wear and tear. But there are moments
              when the inexorable shrinking of the days makes you miss people who have
              not yet left you... It is as if you have come unmoored from your present
              – as if you are floating out in the floodplain of your future. So that,
              out of a sort of nostalgia, you might decide yes. All right. It’s
              time.</p>

            <p>To wit: He does not even care who really suffered and who didn’t. To
              him, everyone’s suffered. To talk about it is just a matter of sitting
              one person on a little higher branch than another, and what are people
              doing up a tree to begin with?</p>

            <p>Believe it or not... I am just a regular person who has decided to be
              who I am in life. That’s all. That’s how you make your life magical –
              you take yourself into your own hands and rub a little. You activate
              your identity. And that’s the only way to make, as they say, the world a
              better place; after all, what good are you to anyone without
              yourself?</p>

            <p>History wasn’t that easy to learn, seemed to be what I was learning. It
              wasn’t a static story about dead people. It was a revolving door fraught
              with ghosts still straining to tell their version and turn your head,
              multifaceted and blinding as a cut diamond.</p>

            <p>It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that he himself
              is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man are too
              paltry for an Omnipotent being. How these madmen give themselves away!
              The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created from
              human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow.</p>

            <p>Now, for being quiet. This is by far the more difficult of the two, but
              I have learned through painful experience this one, incontrovertible
              truth, and I am going to put it in italics so you will know I mean it:
              <hi rend="italic">you only have one chance to tell your story for the
                very first time</hi>. One chance. Do you want the first time you tell
              it, when it is imbued with all of the passion and enthusiasm and verve
              you possess, to be when you’re chatting up the UPS guy? Or your mother?
              Or your cat? Trust me, you don’t. You want that first time to be on
              paper, so it’s there forever, recorded in all its juicy, rich, living
              color. When you have already described your brilliant twist or your
              genius plot device or your protagonist’s crippling character flaw, you
              have killed some of your own thrill, whether you realize it or not. Yes,
              it’s an ego rush of the very best kind to watch someone’s eyes widen
              when you tell your tale, but the thrill is very short-lived, and when
              you go to put that twist on paper, it is just a little bit stale. The
              more times you tell it, the duller it becomes. Like a bottle of opened
              champagne, the fizz has faded, but when all of that wonderful
              effervescence is bottled up, seething and bubbling, you have one choice:
              work or explode. That last delicious burst of creativity is what will
              see you through to the end.</p>

            <p>I can’t go to church. I’m not of the generation who simply believe. I
              can’t put my trust in science either, whose most spectacular miracles
              have not been to feed the multitude on five loaves and two fishes, or to
              raise the dead, but to perfect mass destruction and prolong
              senility.</p>

            <p>Like leaves. Just like leaves. Don’t you like them just a little where
              they fall? Don’t you turn them over to see what is written on the other
              side? I like that. I like to see the simple text that can be read or
              not, that lies beneath your feet and mine, read or not. That falls, rain
              and wind, though nobody scoops it up to take it home. Life fell at your
              feet and you kicked her away and she bled on your shoes and when you
              came home, your mother said, ‘Look at you, covered in leaves.’</p>

            <p>Into the clockwork universe the quantum child. Why doesn’t every mother
              believe her child can change the world? The child can. Here is the joke.
              Here we are still looking for a saviour and hundreds are being born
              every second. Look at it, this tiny capsule of new life, indifferent to
              your prejudices, your miseries, unmindful of the world already made.
              Make it again? They could if we let them, but we make sure they grow up
              just like us, fearful like us. Don’t let them know the potential that
              they are.</p>

            <p>Heaven or Hell in the hereafter will be luggage or the lack of it. The
              ones who recognised that love is enough and that possessions are
              borrowed pastimes, will float free through the exit sign, their arms
              ready to hug their friends, their toothbrush in their pocket. The ones
              who stayed up late, gathering and gathering like demented bees, will
              find that you can take it with you. The joke is that you have to carry

            <p>It’s an idea that many people seem to latch on to that if we were
              created by some kind of god, then obviously he did it because he loves
              us so huggy-muggy much. Never are the holes in this theory more obvious
              than while playing god games because it seems when you place most people
              in the position of a god and give them responsibility over many tiny
              lesser beings, then their attitude towards them is usually less about
              beloved children and more about target practice.</p>

            <p>For just as happiness is more than the absence of sadness, so is peace
              infinitely more than the absence of war. Even the refugee must do more
              than flee. He must arrive. He must return at last to a world as it is,
              however much in conflict with his hopes, and he must then do what he can
              to edge reality toward what he has dreamed, to change what he can
              change, to go beyond the wish or the fantasy.</p>

            <p>The path to wisdom does, in fact, begin with a single step.</p>
            <p>Where people go wrong is in ignoring all the thousands of other steps
              that come after it. They make the single step of deciding to become one
              with the universe, and for some reason forget to take the logical next
              step of living for seventy years on a mountain and a daily bowl of rice
              and yak-butter tea that would give it any kind of meaning. While
              evidence says that the road to hell is paved with good intentions,
              they’re probably all first steps.</p>

            <p>...People have always been dimly aware of the problem with the start of
              things. They wonder aloud how the snowplow driver gets to work, or how
              the makers of dictionaries look up the spellings of words. Yet there is
              the constant desire to find some point on the twisting, knotting,
              raveling net of space-time on which a metaphorical finger can be put to
              indicate that here, <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, is the point where it

            <p>The reason death sticks so closely to life isn’t biological necessity -
              it’s envy. Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it, a
              jealous, possessive love that grabs at what it can. But life leaps over
              oblivion lightly, losing only a thing or two of no importance, and gloom
              is but the passing shadow of a cloud.</p>

            <p>Science-fiction is the law-abiding citizen of imaginative literature,
              obeying the rules, be they physical, social, or psychological, keeping
              regular hours, eating punctual meals; predictable, certain, sure. </p>
            <p>Fantasy, on the other hand, is criminal. Each fantasy assaults and
              breaks a particular law; the crime being hidden by the author’s
              felicitous thought and style which cover the body before blood is seen. </p>
            <p>Science-fiction works hand-in-glove with the universe. </p>
            <p>Fantasy cracks it down the middle, turns it wrong-side-out, dissolves
              it to invisibility, walks men through its walls, and fetches incredible
              circuses to town with sea-serpent, medusa, and chimera displacing zebra,
              ape, and armadillo. </p>

              anything out. We are cups, constantly and quietly being filled. The

          <p>Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both
          victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere
          veneer of vanity, is it vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished.
          However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation, stands
          vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin
          vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious
          violation of volition. The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held
          as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one
          day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of
          verbiage veers most verbose so let me simply add that it’s my very good
          honor to meet you and you may call me V.</p>

            <p><said>Why do people do evil things?</said></p>
            <p>The Professor nods, tugging on his white tuft of beard. <said>It is our true
              selves: our identity as they appear in nature. The natural world is full
              of disorder and so, by our flawed definition, the natural world is evil.
              We are immoral by design, and so when we act evilly, we are only
              revealing our most basic selves, the simplest, most convenient action,
              to fend for oneself and oneself only. To do right – to act unjustly, to
              put the needs of someone else before your own – now that is an act of
              true mystery. It is completely unnatural – a gigantic step beyond the
              jungle instincts of man and a leap into the unknown wisdom of silent
              grace which lurks, harbored in the small vessel of mankind, within us

            <p>My father, for those who came in late, is a (now retired) professor of
              English, and I’ve taken several courses from him over the years. He’s a
              remarkable teacher, dressed up in his professorial sweater (for Dad, it
              was always a sweater — I’m not sure why, but to this day when he
              happens to wear a sweater I have an urge to take notes and pretend to be
              listening to what he says) and sipping tea in the front of the class. He
              guides discussion deftly, leads commentary adroitly, and has a
              remarkable facility to remember what others have written about a book
              essentially verbatim. And when you think you have him cornered and
              you’re closing in for the kill — rhetorically speaking — he has this
              annoying habit of smiling, looking a bit proud, and saying <said>you know,
              there’s probably a paper in that.</said> And then you have to write it.</p>

            <p>It was, in fact, one of those places that exist merely so that people

              villages, windswept little towns under wide skies, isolated cabins on
              chilly mountains, whose only mark on history is to be the incredibly
              ordinary place where something extraordinary started to happen. Often
              there is no more than a little plaque to reveal that, against all

              away – until the clock he wound up winds down, until the wine she made
              has finished fermenting, until the crop they planted is harvested. The
              span of someone’s life, they say, is only the core of their actual
              existence.</p>

            <p>It goes like this. I spent <hi rend="bold">years</hi>. And I mean
              every <hi rend="bold">minute</hi> of them. Building you this... huge
              house inside of my heart. It had many little rooms where we could be
              silly, or naked, or sweet-sap corny. Or maybe we could just talk or
              fight or be together in silence. Nothing was missing. Except you. So I
              waited.</p>
            <p>But you never arrived, and the house started decaying. And I, I just
              couldn’t <hi rend="bold">stand</hi> it. And so I burned it down and
              demolished the whole thing with a steamroller.</p>
            <p>And suddenly... here you are, with your little suitcase. You find me
              standing among the ruins. And then you ask me why I’m so sad. And
              <hi rend="bold">then</hi> you ask me why I’m so <hi rend="bold">angry</hi>.</p>

            <p>Wars have no memory, and nobody has the courage to understand them
              until there are no voices left to tell what happened, until the moment
              comes when we no longer recognize them and they return, with another

            <p>Do not confuse <soCalled>duty</soCalled> with what other people expect of you; they are
              utterly different. Duty is a debt you owe yourself to fulfill
              obligations you have assumed voluntarily. Paying that debt can entail
              anything from years of patient work to instant willingness to die.
              Difficult it may be, but the reward is self-respect.</p>
            <p>But there is no reward at all for doing what other people expect of
              you, and to do so is not merely difficult, but impossible... So learn to
              say No – and to be rude about it when necessary.</p>
            <p>(This rule does not mean that you must not do a favor for a friend, or
              even a stranger. But let that choice be <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>.
              Don’t do it because it is <soCalled>expected</soCalled> of you.)</p>

            <p>Age does not bring wisdom. Often it merely changes simple stupidity
              into arrogant conceit. Its only advantage, so far as I have been able to
              see, is that it spans <hi rend="italic">change</hi>. A young person sees
              the world as a still picture, immutable. An old person has had his nose
              rubbed in changes and more changes and still more changes so many times
              that he <hi rend="italic">knows</hi> it is a moving picture, forever
              changing. He may not like it – probably doesn’t; <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
              don’t – but he knows it’s so, and knowing it is the first step in coping

              yourself and your accretion of all your secret histories, the sins and
              curses and mercies that ever touched you. People entered and disappeared
              from your life, but they irrevocably left parts of themselves, the way
              that soft candy prayerfully pressed by Korean mothers onto the gates
              where their children were taking their college entrance exams eventually
              hardened and became part of the gate itself.</p>

            <p>As long as we can love each other, and remember the feeling of love we

            <p>A man of God is called by God. A man of the people calls the people.
              Some men are called by God to lead the people. But that’s rare. A man of
              the people thinks the people are calling him but it’s just his own
              voice, overly loud, shouting his own name and hearing it echo back to
              him through the open mouths of the people, mouths open in awe and wonder
              watching a man shout his own name loud. A man of God has his mouth shut
              until God opens it, forces it open sometimes.</p>

            <p>The things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness,
              honesty, understanding and feeling are the concomitants of failure in
              our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed,
              acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest are the traits of
              success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the
              produce of the second.</p>

            <p>How can the poem and the stink and the grating noise – the quality of
              light, the tone, the habit and the dream – be set down alive? When You
              collect marine animals there are certain flatworms so delicate that they
              are almost impossible to capture whole, for they break and tatter under
              the touch. You must let them ooze and crawl of their own will onto a
              knife blade and then lift the gently into your bottle of sea water. And
              perhaps that might be the way to write this book – to open the page and
              to let the stories crawl in by themselves.</p>

            <p>Up to the middle of the 20th century, there was no puberty. People were
              born as something resembling a small monkey, and stayed that way until
              suddenly turning into a fully-grown, adult human being at age 12. The
              traditional way to celebrate that momentous date involved a prearranged
              marriage, a night of passionate love-making, then heading off to some
              war in the morning. Then somebody came up with the idea that, rather
              than sending people off to fight bloody wars in some far-off country
              (involving very costly transportation), you could give people something
              called hormones, and have the war take place right there within their
              own bodies.</p>

            <p>Deep within, someone waits for us in the garden. She is an angel,
              perhaps she is Allah. She is our soul. Or she is our death. Her voice is
              ravishing; and it is fatal to us. We may seek her, or spend our lives in
              flight from her. But always she is waiting in the garden, speaking a
              tongue which we were born speaking. And then forget.</p>

            <p>The destruction of and damage to archaeological evidence is, again in a
              sense, as old as man itself; they are factors inevitable in the process
              of cultural change and are integral to the nature of archaeological
              evidence. If human societies did not cast out the old for the new, knock
              down their inheritance and cover over the resulting debris, there would
              be no cultural layers in the soil and on the landscape and no sequence
              of artifacts. So straightaway archaeology is in a dilemma, a ‘Catch-22’
              situation. It relies on change for its dynamic yet must rigorously
              divert or oppose current change which threatens to obliterate the source
              of that dynamic.</p>

            <p>Man is a curious animal, and much of what now differentiates him from
              the rest of the animal kingdom stems from this fact. In this context,
              his curiosity about his past is on a par with his curiosity about his
              own world and the worlds outside and beyond his own – the dimensions of
              time, space and spirit... We see the past as a challenge too: we know it
              is there, therefore we want to find out about it because it is there and
              we were (and still are) ignorant about it. Not only nature, but the
              human mind too, abhors a vacuum.</p>

            <p><soCalled>1/0</soCalled> is a paradox; in a way that <soCalled>0/1</soCalled> is not. Nothing can be divided
              by zero. If one approaches the formula from the positive side, it would
              appear that the answer is an infinite positive value. If one approaches
              the formula from the negative side, the opposite is true. Thus, anything
              divided by zero is simultaneously positive and negative infinity. <soCalled>One
              over Zero</soCalled> is a paradox in another way too, in a way that transcends
              mere arithmetic. One is something, and Zero is nothing. The fact that
              the universe holds something over nothing, that it prefers to exist,
              rather than not exist, is fundamentally absurd. No being can ever come
              to deserve its own birth. 1/0 is a cry out against mere logic and
              efficiency. Stuff exists. All existence, all truth, cannot be ultimately
              justified: it can only be described, explained, and enjoyed.</p>
            <p>1/0 is illogical. 1/0 is irrational. 1/0 is impossible. 1/0 is
              transcendentally unfair.</p>
            <p>1/0 is true. Deal with it.</p>

            <p>I hate being in the final stages of a story. It’s like trying to run
              programs on a computer with 100% CPU use. I’m left with just about
              enough native intelligence to walk, talk monosyllabically, and tie my
              shoelaces. I assume that I’m off figuring out the end of the story I’m
              writing, because the alternative, in terms of sudden-onset mental decay,
              is too dreadful to think about. Meanwhile I walk around aimlessly,
              cannot remember where I put things, or the names of the things that I
              can’t remember where I put them. And I say <said>er...</said> a lot, and pick
              things up and look at them.</p>

            <p>Courage, I seemed to think, comes to us in finite quantities, like an
              inheritance, and by being frugal and stashing it away and letting it
              earn interest, we steadily increase our moral capital in preparation for
              that day when the account must be drawn down. It was a comforting
              theory. It dispensed with all those bothersome little acts of daily
              courage; it offered hope and grace to the repetitive coward; it
              justified the past while amortizing the future.</p>

              consider himself lucky to be allowed to give his money to the

            <p>The fact is that camels are far more intelligent than dolphins. They
              are so much brighter that they soon realized that the most prudent thing
              any intelligent animal can do, if it would prefer its descendants not to
              spend a lot of time on a slab with electrodes clamped to their brains or
              sticking mines on the bottom of ships or being patronized rigid by
              zoologists, is to make bloody certain humans don’t find out about
              it.</p>

              to learn how to control it. That didn’t mean you let it trickle away. It
              meant you dammed it, carefully, let it develop a working head, let it
              drown whole valleys of the mind and then, just when the whole structure
              was about to collapse, opened a tiny pipeline at the base and let the
              iron-hard stream of wrath power the turbines of revenge.</p>

            <p>People believe... it’s what people do. They believe. And then they will
              not take responsibility for their beliefs; they conjure things, and do
              not trust the conjurations. People populate the darkness; with ghosts,
              with gods, with electrons, with tales. People imagine, and people
              believe: and it is that belief, that rock-solid belief, that makes

            <p>None of this can actually be happening. If it make you more
              comfortable, you could simply think of it as a metaphor. Religions are,
              by definition, metaphors, after all: God is a dream, a hope, a woman, an
              ironist, a father, a city, a house of many rooms, a watchmaker who left
              his prize chronometer in the desert, someone who loves you – even,
              perhaps, against all evidence, a celestial being whose only interest is
              to make sure your football team, army, business, or marriage thrives,
              prospers, and triumphs over all opposition.</p>

            <p>Evil presupposes a moral decision, intention, and some forethought. A
              moron or a lout, however, doesn’t stop to think or reason. He acts on
              instinct, like a stable animal, convinced that he’s doing good, that
              he’s always right, and sanctimoniously proud to go around fucking up, if
              you’ll excuse the French, anyone he perceives to be different form
              himself, be it because of skin color, creed, language, nationality, or...
              leisure habits. What the world needs is more thoroughly evil people and

              on their own and humans will return to living in caves, to medieval
              savagery, and to the general state of imbecility that slugs overcame
              back in the Pleistocene era. Our world will not die as a result of the
              bomb, as the papers say, it will die of laughter, of banality, of making
              a joke of everything, and a poor joke at that.</p>

              tens of thousands more would remain unexplored, forgotten forever. I
              felt myself surrounded by millions of abandoned pages, by worlds and
              souls without an owner sinking in an ocean of darkness, while the world
              that throbbed outside the library seemed to be losing its memory, day

              it. Every time a book changes hands, every time someone runs his eyes
              down its pages, its spirit grows and strengthens.</p>

            <p>When someone is seeking... it happens quite easily that he only sees the
              thing he is seeking; that he is unable to find anything, unable to
              absorb anything, because he is only thinking of the thing he is seeking,
              because he has a goal, because he is obsessed with his goal. Seeking
              means: to have a goal; but finding means: to be free, to be receptive,
              to have no goal.</p>

            <p>Trials never end, of course. Unhappiness and misfortune are bound to
              occur as long as people live, but there is a feeling now, that was not
              here before, and is not just on the surface of things, but penetrates
              all the way through: We’ve won it. It’s going to get better now. You can
              sort of tell these things.</p>

            <p>Technology is blamed for a lot of this loneliness, since the loneliness
              is certainly associated with the newer technological devices – TV, jets,
              freeways and so on – but I hope it’s been made plain that the real evil
              isn’t the objects of technology but the tendency of technology to
              isolate people into lonely attitudes of objectivity.</p>

            <p>Mountains like these and travelers in the mountains and events that

              tales of every major religion. The allegory of a physical mountain for
              the spiritual one that stands between each soul and its goal is an easy
              and natural one to make... There are as many routes as there are

              never anything other than one person talking from one place in time and
              space and circumstance. It’s never been anything else, either, but you

            <p>That black hatred – I began to know why it stayed with me; it was my
              fate at work. In me. And I could tell myself and tell myself that a
              prophecy was a lie,... a bogey made of nothing but words, an echo in the
              wind – yet my body knew the power of prophecy. I could feel the fate
              pulsing dark in my blood as I tried to sleep; I could feel it lying
              heavy in my stomach as I tried to eat; I could feel it in me like a

          <p>The fulfillment of the age-old prophecies was about to take place,
          despite the fact that the enemy himself had read them, knew them, and
          had seen every last one of them come to fruitation exactly as it had
          been laid out.</p>

              They were all interwoven and interlocked, entwined in a thousand ways.
              And all the voices, all the goals, all the yearnings, all the pleasures,
              all the good and evil, all of them together was the world . All of them

            <p>Death doesn’t exist. It never did, it never will. But we’ve drawn so
              many pictures of it, so many years, trying to pin it down, comprehend
              it, we’ve got to thinking of it as an entity, strangely alive and
              greedy. All it is, however, is a stopped watch, a loss, an end, a
              darkness. Nothing. And the carnival wisely knows we’re more afraid of
              Nothing than we are of Something. You can fight Something. But...
              Nothing? Where do you hit it?</p>

            <p>Sometimes the man who looks happiest in town, with the biggest smile,
              is the one carrying the biggest load of sin. There are smiles and
              smiles; learn to tell the dark variety from the light. The seal-barker,
              the laugh-shouter, half the time he’s covering up. He’s had his fun and
              he’s guilty. And men <hi rend="italic">do</hi> love sin, Will, oh how
              they love it, never doubt, in all shapes, sizes, colors, and smells.
              Times come when troughs, not tables, suit our appetites. Hear a man too
              loudly praising others and look to wonder if he didn’t just get up from
              the sty. On the other hand, that unhappy, pale, put upon man walking by,
              who looks all guilt and sin, why, often that’s your good man with a
              capital G, Will. For being good <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a fearful
              occupation; men strain at it and sometimes break in two. I’ve known a
              few. You work twice as hard to be a farmer as to be his hog. I suppose
              it’s thinking about trying to be good makes the crack run up the wall
              one night. A man with high standards, too, the least hair falls on him
              sometimes wilts his spine. He can’t let himself alone, won’t lift
              himself off the hook if he falls just a breath from grace.</p>

            <p>First of all, it was October, a rare month for boys. Not that all
              months aren’t rare. But there be bad and good, as the pirates say. Take
              September, a bad month: school begins. Consider August, a good month:
              school hasn’t begun yet. July, well, July’s really fine: there’s no
              chance in the world for school. June, no doubting it, June’s best of
              all, for the school doors spring wide and September’s a billion years
              away.</p>

            <p>Reading at meals is considered rude in polite society, but if you
              expect to succeed as a writer, rudeness should be the second-to-least of
              your concerns. The least of all should be polite society and what it
              expects. If you intend to write as truthfully as you can, your days as a
              member of polite society are numbered anyway.</p>

            <p><said>Now if that happens to you, and you want to see someone you’re
              missing, you just call us up at 767-8900 and leave a message, talk as
              long as you want and tell me what you want to hear. ’Cause music works
              as good as food. Brings back old times and old folks. Makes your
              wallpaper change right there on the wall to what you had when you were a
              baby, or maybe to when you and your baby first met. So let’s turn the
              clock back and raise a few ghosts.</said></p>

            <p><said>Sure there’s hardship out there, and suffering, but you don’t have to
              let it get you down. That’s not the only reality. All the religions,
              every one of ’em, tell you there’s another world behind this one. That’s
              what religion is all about, getting you across the busy street, with all
              the horns honking and distractions and accidents. But on the other side,
              there’s harmony. That’s where artists live. They’re telling us about
              it... And writing down what it sounds like. And it’s full of joy.</said></p>

            <p>The constitution of the human mind is such, that if it once disregards
              the conviction forced upon it by a revelation of truth, it requires the

            <p>You take your material where you find it, which is in your life, at the
              intersection of past and present. The memory-traffic feeds into a rotary
              up on your head, where it goes in circles for awhile, then pretty soon
              imagination flows in and the traffic merges and shoots off down a
              thousand different streets. As a writer, all you can do is pick a street
              and go for the ride, putting things down as they come at you.</p>
